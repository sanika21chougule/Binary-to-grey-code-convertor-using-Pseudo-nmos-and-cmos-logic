# Binary-to-grey-code-convertor-using-Pseudo-nmos-and-cmos-logic
A Binary-to-Gray code converter uses Cadence to design circuits with pseudo-CMOS and NMOS logic. It converts n-bit binary input to Gray code output, ensuring only one bit changes between successive values, reducing switching errors. Logic gates implement XOR/XNOR for conversion.
